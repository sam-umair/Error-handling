* Use of try-except:
* The try-except block is used for error handling in Python.
* It helps your program not crash when something goes wrong — instead, it handles the error gracefully.
* Concept of Self:
* In Python, self refers to the current instance of the class.
* It’s like saying: “this object right here.”
* Key Points:
* try-except handles errors so your code doesn’t crash.
* self helps your class methods and variables refer to the current object they’re working with.
